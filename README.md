Throughout my work experiences, I found the following quite ironic:

<ul>
  <li>An interviewer conducting a pressure interview — while their own team has zero sales.</li> <br />
  <li>An engineer designing a full-scale architecture — for a service with under 1,000 DAU.</li> <br />
  <li>An HR manager looking for a “perfect” developer — while offering low pay and full responsibility.</li> <br />
  <li>A product owner crafting seamless Figma pages all day — without ever defining the user’s pain points.</li> <br />
  <li>A CEO giving passionate speeches about the company vision — while never talking to employees face to face.</li> 
</ul>
If you want someone to live up to your expectations, you should do the same.

Be realistic, brother.
