People say two things which I considered not true. 

First. Bitcoin is scam. I'm super dumb so please kindly explain to me then why the fuck it is 100K a coin.

Second. AI will take programmers out of jobs.  Again, I'm super dumb so please patiently guide me why the fuck you haven't replace all the jobs with it already.

First one is based on arrogance and second one is about exploiting FOMO.

Outside arena, you can say whatever you want. Talk is cheap.

Haven't asked your advice. I been following my instinct and knowledge and I will keep doing it.
