# Blog | Introduction

When random thoughts hit me at midnight, I felt there should be a way to express those somewhere.

It would be hard to say I'm at the top of my career, at all, but throughout the journey I happened to have my own view towards certain topics.

For example,

- Do you need a CS degree to be a software engineer?
- Do I rent monthly or Jeonse(Key money deposit)?
- How much saving should I keep monthly? Or just spend every penny?
- When should I quit 9 to 5? Or, should I just do forever till retirement?
- Is college useless when getting a job?

So topics and tones will be quite random and raw as I just pour them out online without second thoughts.
