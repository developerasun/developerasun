# Portfolio

A list of side projects by me.

Some of them are being maintained, some of them has been shutdown,
and a carefully selected one is not disclosed here.

## 💀 Dead ones

These are side projects that I had quit in the middle.
Codes exist but not hosted anywhere so no way to show the demo now.
