# Projects | Lapis Protocol

## Overview

AOS reward app, Play to earn, Web3 project.

<div style={{ width: "75%", margin: "1rem auto" }}>

</div>

The main idea was simple - user plays a mobile game and claims a ERC20 token based on game playtime.

From the service launch(`Nov 2023`) and end of service(`Aug 2025`), I was working on this project with following teammates.

- 1 project manager
- 1 product owner
- 1 product designer
- 2 frontend developers
- 3 backend developers

[Project itself](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mithril.lapis) might have been dead(or alive) after I left the company,
but smart contracts I coded still exist on L2 Optimism mainnet.

## Role in the project

I was mainly responsible for smart contract and web server, handling onchain transactions with failover.
