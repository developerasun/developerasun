Play to earn Android app, made with teammates:

- tech: 2 mobile, 2 backend, 1 blockchain(me)
- product: 1 pm, 1 po, 1 designer

Mainly responsible for handling smart contract and web3 server.

[Project itself](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mithril.lapis) might have been dead(or alive) after I left the company,
but smart contracts I did still exist on Optimism network(and they forever will).

Check out a list of verified smart contracts I coded during the project.

- [ERC20](https://optimism.blockscout.com/token/0x52F7A03f16fDd984458D88a7e9cd74256b328a3b)
- [ERC721](https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0xEE8e2B125F6eeD2da17dCE622B4caccE78d5578c)
- [ERC1155](https://optimism.blockscout.com/token/0x0Eea4043EB43143D2b2121c3cA7083161eAb67Df)
- [Reward utility](https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x473B185e92ed5f4E5e2C8A00C7880ceD029A6EA9)
- [Upgradeable: proxy](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0xD7EaBf942a446D278AfD9a00B4aAe188b0664B21)
- [Upgradeable: implementation](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0x19A849cfA6588AA206BB0A8f65b46B08d1D1c3F4)

Note that these have been all public at the moment of deployment while upgradeable implementaiton's ABI not disclosed for the security.
