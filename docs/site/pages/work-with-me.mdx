<div style={{ width: "50%", margin: "0 auto" }}>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: "50%" }}

## Motivation

Sometimes I got mails and dms on social with different offers and inquiries.

- Headhunters from Linkedin.
- Small business owners from Pinterest.
- Uni students who want to be a software engineer from Github.
- Collaboration offers from Instagram.

And most of the time I could not reply or capture the offer at the time because,

either

1. I was in the middle of corporate jobs, Or
2. The inquiries were out of my coverage, Or
3. Busy building my own projects.

So I'm thinking of creating this page as an online hub, organizing these needs.

This will make things much more manageable.

## How to

Let's take a look at a list of works that might be beneficial for both of us.
